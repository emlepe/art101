    <h1>Lab 12: Conditionals</h1>
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>The objective for this lab was for my partner and I to create a function
      that sorts you into .</p>
    <h2>Problems</h2>
    <p> I had trouble with getting the button to work, I kept
    getting SyntaxErrors: "missing ) after argument list." Could not figure out what
    element I was missing after scouring my Atom for it... Did I miss something else
    entirely?
    </p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>I was able to create a straightforward conditional in my function.</p>

        Please enter your FULL name for sorting:
        <input type="text" id="input">
        <button id="button">Submit</button>
