    <h1>Lab 12: Conditionals</h1>
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p>Working with my partner, we created a function that depends on conditionals.</p>
    <h2>Problems</h2>
    <p> I had trouble with getting the button to work, I kept
    getting SyntaxErrors: "missing ) after argument list." Could not figure out what
    element I was missing after scouring my Atom for it... Did I miss something else
    entirely?
    </p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>I was able to create a straightforward conditional in my function.</p>
