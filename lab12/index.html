    <h1>Lab 12: Conditionals</h1>
    <p>The objective for this lab was for my partner and I to create a function in Javascript
      that sorts you into a Hogwarts House using conditionals.</p>
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <p> This was the most challenging lab for us thus far. Navigating the instructions
    felt like going through all the moving staircases at Hogwarts.</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>I was able to create a straightforward conditional in my function.</p>

    <div class="input-output">
        <h2>Welcome to Hogwarts</h2>
        <p>Prepare To Be Sorted Into Your House</p>
        Please enter your FULL name for sorting:
        <input type="text" id="input">
        <button id="button">Submit</button>
        <div id="output">
        </div>
