    <h1>Lab 12: Conditionals</h1>
    <p>The objective for this lab was for my partner and I to debug old labs
    that may still have problems.</p>
    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    Going back to old concepts on my own was challenging on its own!
    <p> </p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>I was able to (hopefully) debug any past labs.</p>
