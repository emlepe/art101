      <h1>Lab 8: Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
      <h2>Objectives</h2>
      <p>Working with my partner, we experimented with anonymous
        callbacks.</p>
      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>We found this lab to be much easier once we began. We ran into
      small syntax errors, "like the omission of a semicolon or something
      of the same caliber." Once all of the errors were corrected, the js
      ran smoothly.</p>
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>Check the console to see the output! :)</p>
