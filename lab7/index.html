          <h1>Lab 7: Functions</h1>
          <h2> Objectives </h2>
          <p>Working with my partner, we created a function that took our user input.
        </p>

          <h2>Challenges</h2>
          <p>We had to experiment with the variables, we ran into an error where the console
          was telling us we had a reference error, and we could not figure out why.
        It turns out that there was a typo in the reference image linked on the tutorial page:
       It said to have nameArraySort for 2 lines, however, we only needed it for one. Once we
      figured this out, we were able to correctly run our page both offline and online. </p>
          <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>Well, you're looking at the js file, the script output can be found below:</p>
                      	<img src="img/function.png" width=400 length=300/>
            <div>
                <h2>Script Output</h2>
                <script src="js/lab7.js"></script>
            </div>
        </div>
